Welcome [react native](https://reactnative.dev/), now JavaScript runs on Android, Windows and iOS like anywhere!

Being a JavaScript developer, making mobile apps was just a WebView with our site running.
But now, we have [react native](https://reactnative.dev/) which takes a but different approach and makes the application feel like a truly native application. It's having components to make android and iOS like UI.

And the code actually resembles the react code.
That means that you can make native apps with a little knowledge of [react native](https://reactnative.dev/).

### install
``` bash
npm install -g create-react-native-app
# OR
yarn add -g create-react-native-app
```
### initialize
``` bash
create-react-native-app myReactiveApp
```
This will install and configure react-native in a directory.

### the cli!
the cli comes pretty handy in react-native. Install it with:
``` bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
# OR
yarn add -g react-native-cli
```

#### using the cli
use yarn run to see available commands for your project:
``` bash
yarn run
```


### basics
React-native is really easy if you know some react
You can quickly [learn the basics here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial) if you have a good knowledge of react.

### why react native ?
![it's good :)](https://c.tenor.com/fjdrDuVtEkAAAAAM/confused-look.gif)
React native comes with a lot of advantages for a JavaScript developer
- open source
- free
- great community

### any alternative ?
Yes!, See my next article for intro to android.js which ships your nodejs application to and Android app!
